In this assignment, you will recreate a variation of an example from the textbook.
Specifically, the example showing how the number of expanded states varies with
the difficulty of the 8-puzzle (length of optimal solution) and comparing the
performance of multiple search algorithms.

Write a Java program that does the following:

1) Generates 100 random instances of the 8-puzzle that have an optimal solution
   of length 2 (see Examples.java and the documentation of the SlidingTilePuzzle
   class to see how to generate 1 such instance).

2) Solve each of those 100 random instances with each of the following search algorithms:
   Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
   A* with misplaced tiles heuristic
   A* with manhattan distance heuristic
   Iterative Deepening
   IDA* with misplaced tiles heuristic
   IDA* with manhattan distance heuristic

3) While doing #2 above, for each search algorithm, compute the average number of expanded
   states (averaged across the 100 random instances), the average number of generated states,
   and the average of the max states in memory.  See the documentation for the PuzzleSolution
   class and for the SlidingTilePuzzleSolver class, and the examples in Examples.java.

4) Steps 1, 2, and 3 should be repeated for optimal path lengths of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.

5) Have your program generate and output tables containing the average data.  See toward the
   bottom of this file for an example of what the output should look like.

--------------------------------------------------

6) Answer the following questions:

6A) Describe in words the relative pattern of number of expanded states for UCS and A*
    with the two different heuristics.

6B)	Why do we find that pattern?

6C) Describe in words the relative pattern of number of expanded states for Iterative Deepening
    and IDA* with the two different heuristics.

6D) Why do we find that pattern? And how does that pattern compare to what you saw in 6A and 6B?

6E) Describe the memory usage (max states in memory) that you observed for UCS, and the
    two variations of A*.

6F) Describe the relative memory usage (max states in memory) that you observed for Iterative Deepening
    and IDA* with the two different heuristics.

6G) Explain the memory usage that you observed for the three iterative deepening algorithms (IDA* and ID)
    versus the others (UCS and A*).

7) Upload and submit the following files:
7a) The java sourcecode for the program you wrote to generate the data (the .java file).
7b) A text file containing the output of that program.
7c) A file with your answers to the questions from step 6.



Example Output: Here is an example of the expected output of your program.
Note that the numbers you get will be different than mine (program is generating
random start states, so your program will see different start states than mine did).
However, the numbers should be somewhat similar, so if yours are rather different
than what is found below, then you might have a bug in how you are computing the
averages.  You're not required to output the data to two decimal places as below,
but may be easier to read if you do (e.g., you can use System.out.printf to
accomplish that).  In my tables A*1 and IDA*1 use misplaced tiles.  A*2 and IDA*2
use manhattan distance.
