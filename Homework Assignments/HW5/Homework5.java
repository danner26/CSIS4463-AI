/**
 * For this assignment, you will need the puzzle.jar file and its documentation (docs.zip) 
 * from homework 4, and the Examples.java will be useful as well.
 *
 * In Java, implement any search algorithm that we saw in class to solve sliding tile
 * puzzles, such as the 8 puzzle, 15 puzzle, etc.
 *
 * You must not change the name, parameters, or return type of the solver method.
 * You are free to add as many helper methods as you find useful.
 *
 * You are free to use the MinHeapPQ class that is in the puzzle.jar (see its documentation).
 * It supports changing the priority of elements that are in the PQ, whereas the PQ implementation
 * in the Java API does not support that operation.
 *
 * Grading:
 * Your grade will be in the interval [0, 100] if you implement an algorithm that is guaranteed
 * to find the optimal path.  Otherwise, if you implement an algorithm that is not
 * guaranteed to find the optimal path (e.g., DFS), then your grade will be in the interval [0, 85]
 * (i.e., you lose 15 points for the non-optimal algorithms).
 *
 * If your code doesn't compile, then your grade will be in the interval [0, 60] depending upon the severity
 * of the syntax errors.  i.e., make sure your code compiles (you lose at least 40 points if it doesn't.
 *
 * After completing the solver method, write code to demonstrate that it works in the Homework5Main class.
